#PeopleTrafficFlow
This is the web server application allowing to manage people flow in huge office buildings. Eventually, it will get the situational data about how many people are waiting for the elevator, combine it with the current elevators workload and use the data input from users to be able to improve the overall elevator movements operation and people traffic flow in the hallways.

To try it out, you should import it as a maven project and deploy the .war file from target folder to the Liberty WebSphere Application Server running locally or in the cloud. It will accept user data as JSONs and process it.
